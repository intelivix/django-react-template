## Base Django React Project

This is a simple Django React application based on my experience as a developer.
Suggestions and feedbacks are welcome!

The main idea is to use Django Rest Framework (DRF) as a backend supply for the React. They will work independently and connect through the Docker network only.

### Running with DOCKER

In development environment this project will work using containers. As for production, it can be build in whatever you want.

##### Starting up!
* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
* `$ docker-compose build`
* `$ docker-compose up`
